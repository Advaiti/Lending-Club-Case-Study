## General Information
- Background: This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about past loan applicants to understand the factors that influence loan defaults.
Business Problem: The primary goal is to minimize financial losses due to loan defaults by identifying risky applicants. By understanding the driving factors behind defaults, the company can make informed decisions on loan approvals, set appropriate interest rates, and manage risk effectively.
Dataset: The dataset includes detailed records of loan applications from 2007 to 2011, including applicant demographics, loan characteristics, and repayment status.

## Conclusions
- Loan Amount: Higher loan amounts are associated with higher default rates, indicating increased risk with larger loans.
- Interest Rates: Borrowers with higher interest rates tend to default more, suggesting that higher rates are a risk indicator.
- Annual Income: Lower annual incomes correlate with higher default rates, emphasizing the importance of assessing borrower income.
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Higher DTIs are linked to increased default risk, indicating over-leveraged borrowers are more likely to default.
- Loan Term: Loans with longer terms (60 months) have higher default rates compared to shorter-term loans (36 months).
- Home Ownership: Homeowners have lower default rates compared to renters or those with other housing situations.
- Verification Status: Verified income status is associated with lower default rates, highlighting the importance of income verification.
- Employment Length: Longer employment history correlates with lower default rates, suggesting job stability is a key factor in loan repayment.
- Loan Purpose: Certain loan purposes, such as small business loans, have higher default rates compared to others like credit card refinancing.
- Geographic Influence: Default rates vary significantly by state, indicating regional economic factors play a role in loan repayment.
- Public Record Bankruptcies: Borrowers with public record bankruptcies have higher default rates, underscoring the risk associated with such histories.
